To get the most out of the video lectures, follow these steps

    1.  For sharing code / snippets / write-ups, refrain from using the chat box.
        Content shared though chat boxes, often loose the original formatting and indentation, making 
        it difficult for us to use the content write away.
        Instead go to, https://pastebin.com/, paste your code there, and share the link in chatbox.
        
    2.  Open the Hangouts window 50% with respect to your screen size and keep it to the right or left of your screen according 
        to your preferences, and along side open Jupyter Notebook to type out some of the code.
        
    3.  The Jupyter Notebook files will be shared here on Github for you to download.
    
    4.  The assignments given to you as homework, must be submitted on the next class date and are to be sent to 
        ranajoy123saha@gmail.com after completion. The solution and the corrected assignment will be sent before
        the next class.
    
    5.  The notes on each topics will be provided to you
